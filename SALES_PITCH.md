# CofounderChat - Sales One-Pager

## What Is It?

**CofounderChat** is an AI co-founder that thinks in Conscious Economics—it calculates both revenue impact AND Time Violence (hours wasted by complexity).

Traditional AI tells you what to do.  
CofounderChat tells you the **full cost** (money + time) and helps you decide.

---

## Example: Should We Hire a CSM?

**Traditional AI:**
```
Hiring a CSM at $80K will improve customer success.
```

**CofounderChat:**
```
<|assumptions|>
CSM handles 200 accounts, reduces churn 8% → 5%

<|metrics|>
Traditional ROI: -64% (looks bad)
  Revenue saved: $36K
  Cost: $80K + $20K overhead = $100K
  
Conscious ROI: +107% (great hire!)
  Revenue: $36K
  Time value: $171K (customers + support team time saved)
  Total value: $207K
  Cost: $100K
  Net: $107K profit

Recommendation: Hire the CSM
Time value is 4.75x the revenue impact
```

The model shows you what traditional analysis misses: **time is money**.

## What It Calculates

### 1. Time Violence
Hours wasted by:
- Waiting (queue theory)
- Complexity (information theory)  
- Friction (operational overhead)

**Formula:** TV = Ops + Info  
**Output:** "This creates 16.33 hours of Time Violence"

### 2. Consciousness Index
How much is automated vs manual labor?

**Formula:** C(S) = 1 - (TVH / TV)  
**Output:** "C(S) = 0.80 (80% automated)"

### 3. Time Dividends
Who gets the hours back when you save time?

**Formula:** Users 60%, Navigators 20%, Company 20%  
**Output:** "Users: 60h, Navigators: 20h, Company: 20h"

### 4. Conscious ROI
Revenue + Time Value, not just revenue.

**Formula:** C-ROI* = Revenue + (vₜ × hours saved) + other factors  
**Output:** "$10,542 (traditional $10K + time value $542)"

## Use Cases

### Product Decisions
- "Should we build feature X?" → Tests assumptions, calculates C-ROI
- "Price increase: $49 to $79?" → Impact analysis with Time Violence
- "Free tier vs paid only?" → Economics including support Time Violence

### Hiring Decisions
- "Hire CSM at $80K?" → Traditional vs Conscious ROI comparison
- "Contractor at $80/hr vs FTE?" → Total economic cost analysis
- "Build team or outsource?" → Time Violence of each option

### Marketing/Sales
- "Can we claim '10x faster'?" → Demands evidence, checks compliance
- "Sell user data?" → Flags legal/ethical issues immediately
- "Pricing page redesign?" → Visitor Time Violence reduction value

### Build vs Buy
- "Build internal tool or buy SaaS?" → Total economic cost (money + time)
- "White-label version?" → Time Violence of support complexity
- "Add live chat?" → Human time cost vs customer time saved

## FAQs

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT + prompting?**  
A: CofounderChat has Conscious Economics BAKED IN. The model is trained to always calculate Time Violence and C-ROI. It's not prompt engineering—it's the model's native reasoning.

**Q: Can I run it locally?**  
A: Yes! After training, the model runs on your laptop or any server. No API costs.

**Q: How big is the model?**  
A: ~100M parameters. Small enough to run locally, big enough to be useful.

**Q: When do I get access?**  
A: Within 48 hours of payment. I rent GPUs, run training, send you the model.

**Q: What if I don't like it?**  
A: Full refund if model doesn't calculate Time Violence correctly. No questions asked.

**Q: Can I see it first?**  
A: The code is open source (https://github.com/leoguinan/cofounderchat). You can see exactly what it does. The model just needs to be trained (requires GPUs).

**Q: Why $100?**  
A: That's literally the GPU cost ($96) + $4 for my time setting it up. I'm not making money yet—just validating people want this.

## Why Now?

I'm pre-selling to validate demand before scaling.

**If 10 people buy:** I invest in 170K training examples → production model → $500 pricing  
**If 0 people buy:** I saved $96 in GPU costs by testing first  

This is Time Violence reduction in practice: test assumptions before building.

Want to be founding member? $100 gets you in.

**P.S.** This entire sales pitch was written using Conscious Economics principles:
- No false claims (everything is verifiable)
- Transparent pricing (literally my GPU cost)
- Trust through evidence (code is open source)
- Pre-sale de-risks investment (test demand first)

Practice what you preach.
